This is a README file for Mastermind.

# Instructions:

I will come up with a secret 4-color code. Your job is to guess the correct colors in the correct order within 10 turns. After each guess I will give you two hints to tell how close you were. Guess the code... and you win!
    Use up your turns... GAME OVER :(

    Would you like to (p)lay OR (q)uit?
