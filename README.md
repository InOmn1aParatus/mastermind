# Mastermind

Mastermind is a REPL-based program that mimics the popular tabletop game, *Codebreaker*. Using the command line, a user is able to play through 10 rounds of a game designed to test their own logic to crack the four-color code (e.g. RGBY).

## How to Play

To win, you must guess the correct RGBY sequence in 10 or fewer turns. After each turn, the game will provide you with a hint. This will tell you both how many colors you guessed correctly and how many colors are in the correct positions.

## Learning Goals

Mastermind was a 10-day group project for Turing School's Back End Engineering Program. The purpose of the project was to learn how to create a REPL-based program that operated through various "if" statements and employed both abstraction and the single-responsibility principle of OOP.
